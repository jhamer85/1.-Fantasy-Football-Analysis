# 🏈 Fantasy Football Projects  
Self-directed fantasy football projects combining data analysis, coding, and custom tools.

This repository showcases personal projects I created to combine my passion for fantasy football with data analytics and spreadsheet modeling. Each project reflects hands-on learning and practical problem-solving with real-world application.

## 📈 Project 1: Fantasy Football Auction Draft Tool (Excel)

🎯 **Goal:**  
Design a practical, real-time budget tracker and team builder for in-person auction league drafts.

🧠 **What It Does:**  
- Tracks budget per team with real-time updates  
- VLOOKUP integration to match player data across worksheets  
- Built-in formulas to calculate remaining money in the auction

🛠️ **Tools Used:**  
- Microsoft Excel  
- VLOOKUP, conditional formatting, dynamic formulas

🚧 **Status:**  
Complete and available for review. Updated tweaks as I learn new code and think of improvements.

📎 **Why It Matters:**  
Auction drafts can get chaotic. This tool brings structure, strategy, and sanity to a high-stakes environment.

## 📊 Project 2: 2024 Tight End Scoring Box Plot (Python)

🎯 **Goal:**  
Explore scoring trends for Tight Ends in the 2024 season using a box plot to identify outliers and consistency.

🧠 **What I Did:**  
- Collected scoring data from fantasypros.com
- Cleaned and structured dataset using Pandas  
- Created custom box plots with Matplotlib  
- Interpreted data for positional tiering and player evaluation

🛠️ **Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

🚧 **Status:**  
Complete and available for review. Potential future expansion to WR and RB positions.

📎 **Conclusions:**
- Njoku was a strong value last year.
- I was surprised by LaPorta's lack of ceiling.
- Several popular TEs, such as LaPorta, Kraft, Freirermuth, etc., provided steady weekly points but were not difference makers at the position.

## 📈 Project 3: 2025 Rookie ADP Trends (Excel + Python)

🎯 **Goal:**
-Track and visualize how rookie players' Average Draft Position (ADP) changes over time.

🧠 **What I Did:**
-Collected ADP data from multiple time points via DynastyDataLab.com
-Used Python to merge the data tables into a unified dataset by player
-Imported the dataset into Excel to build trend visualizations
-Created sparklines to show each player's ADP trajectory over time
-Applied formatting to invert the Y-axis appearance (so lower ADP values appear higher on the graph)
-Color-coded sparklines to reflect whether a player's ADP was trending up or down

🛠️ **Tools Used:**
-Python
-Pandas
-Microsoft Excel

🚧 Status:
Complete and available for review.

📎 Why it matters:
Rookie ADP can shift significantly before and after the NFL Draft, and websites may lag in reflecting these changes. This tool makes it easy to spot rising or falling players and capitalize on that movement during drafts.
