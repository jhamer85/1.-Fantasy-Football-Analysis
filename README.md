## 📈 Project 1: Fantasy Football Auction Draft Tool (Excel)

🎯 **Goal:**  
Design a practical, real-time budget tracker and team builder for in-person auction league drafts.

🧠 **What it does:**  
- Tracks budget per team with real-time updates  
- VLOOKUP integration to match player data across worksheets  
- Built-in formulas to calculate remaining money in the auction

🛠️ **Tools Used:**  
- Microsoft Excel  
- VLOOKUP, conditional formatting, dynamic formulas

🚧 **Status:**  
Complete and available for review. Updated tweaks as I learn new code and think of improvements.

📎 **Why it matters:**  
Auction drafts can get chaotic. This tool brings structure, strategy, and sanity to a high-stakes environment.

## 📊 Project 2: 2024 Tight End Scoring Box Plot (Python)

🎯 **Goal:**  
Explore scoring trends for Tight Ends in the 2024 season using a box plot to identify outliers and consistency.

🧠 **What I did:**  
- Collected scoring data from fantasy sources  
- Cleaned and structured dataset using Pandas  
- Created custom box plots with Matplotlib  
- Interpreted data for positional tiering and player evaluation

🛠️ **Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

🚧 **Status:**  
Complete and available for review. Potential future expansion to WR and RB positions.

📎 **Conclusions:**
- Njoku was a strong value last year.
- I was surprised by LaPorta's lack of ceiling.
- Several popular TEs, such as LaPorta, Kraft, Freirermuth, etc., provided steady weekly points but were not difference makers at the position
